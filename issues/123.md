# Title
Fix build failure: missing static OpenSSL (libssl/libcrypto) when building for musl

# Body
The CI job at https://github.com/hicham-mdous/data_ingestion/actions/runs/19622173721/job/56184241198 failed while building the binary for the x86_64-unknown-linux-musl target due to missing static OpenSSL libraries. Relevant excerpt from the job logs (ref: 1477a6fe25ae08abe6662d4a811c26476702c4df):

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit status: 1
ld: cannot find -lssl: No such file or directory
have you installed the static version of the ssl library ?
ld: cannot find -lcrypto: No such file or directory
have you installed the static version of the crypto library ?
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
error: could not compile `data_ingestion` (bin "data_ingestion") due to 1 previous error
```

# Suggested fixes to unblock CI:

1) Install static OpenSSL system packages in the build image (Alpine):
    - Add to the Dockerfile build stage (before cargo build):
      apk add --no-cache openssl-dev openssl-libs-static musl-dev build-base pkgconfig
    - This provides libssl.a and libcrypto.a required for static linking.

2) Or enable vendored OpenSSL for Rust crates that depend on openssl:
    - In Cargo.toml set openssl-sys with the vendored feature or enable vendored via features for dependent crates. Example:
      openssl = { version = "*", features = ["vendored"] }
    - Export OPENSSL_STATIC=1 in the build environment if needed.

3) Alternative: build a dynamic binary (glibc) instead of static musl if static linking is not required.

Please pick the preferred approach and I can open a PR updating the Dockerfile / build steps.
